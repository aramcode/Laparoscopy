This script calculates the angle between two points in an image. It uses the OpenCV library for image processing and Matplotlib 
for visualization.

## Variables

image_path: stores the path of the image file to be processed.
image: stores the image file read using OpenCV's imread function.
dots_list: holds the coordinates of the dots drawn on the image.

## Functions

mouse_dots: this function takes 4 parameters mouse_key, x_coor, y_coor, and flag. It is an event handler that listens for
left-button mouse events on the image.  If the left button is clicked, the function draws a dot on the image at the location of the 
click, and if three dots have been drawn, it connects them with a line.

gradient_finder: this function takes two parameters dot_1 and dot_2 and returns the gradient of the line formed by these two dots.

angle_evaluator: this function takes the dots_list as a parameter and evaluates the angle between the last three dots in the list. 
It calculates the gradient of the two lines formed by these dots, calculates the angle between them, and returns the angle in degrees.

## Usage

The script takes a single optional command-line argument --file, which specifies the file path of the image to be processed. 
If the argument is not provided, the default value is grasp_1.jpg. The script displays the image in a window and listens for 
mouse events. The user can draw dots on the image by clicking the left mouse button, and the script will display the angle 
between the last three dots if they have been drawn. The script continues to listen for mouse events until the window is closed.
